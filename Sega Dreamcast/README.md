# Dreamcast (Sega)

This collection is complete.

Several games here were Japanese releases only so the manuals have been translated by Google.  These are Death Crimson 2, and virtua Cop 2.  However,  Death Crimson 2 was released in English on te PS2, and Viruta Cop 2 saw an English language Dreamcast release as part of the Sega Smash Pack as well as on the Saturn and PS2, so those manuals can be referred to if you need a better translation.
If you can offer superior human translations then please get in touch.
