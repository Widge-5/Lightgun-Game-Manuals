GAMEPLAY
The object is to traverse the enemy jungle territory, fending off hostile fire
and destroying a series of enemy bases, to reach safe ground.  You must shoot
your enemies but remember that some of the larger ones need to be hit several 
times before they are destroyed.  If you fail to destroy the enemy quickly 
enough he will fire back and you will lose one of your three lives.  You must 
collect ammo along the way by shooting it or you will soon run out. Be 
careful - some of the enemy snipers are well camoflaged and watch out for body 
heat detecting homing missiles - they're dangerous!
