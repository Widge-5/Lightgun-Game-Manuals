# Super NES (Nintendo)

This collection is complete, or at least as complete as it can be.
Three M.A.C.S. training packages were developed for the US Military, but only one of these is known to have been dumped, and I have not found manuals for the other two.  if the manuals for the other two surface, then i shall include them here.

Shien's Revenge is sometimes listed as a lightgun game in some collections. However, it is not.  it can be played with a mouse, but this does not translate into the absolute positioning for lightguns.

StarFox/StarWing was not developed as a lightgun game, but a fan-made hack has added lightgun functionality to it.  The manual has been included here for general advice on how the game is played, but it does not offer any useful information regarding the setup and use of a lightgun.
