# Playstation (Sony)

This collection is complete.

Galaxian 3 was not developed as a lightgun game, the mouse control doesn't translate reliably for lightgun use. however, the game does support Analog stick controls with absolute positioning.  If used with the right emulator, you can map a lightgun peripheral  to the analog stick and play with a lightgun. As such, the manual has been included here for general advice on how the game is played, but it does not offer any useful information regarding the setup and use of a lightgun.

I have been unable to find an English language manual for Galaxian 3 so a Japanese language manual has been translated by Google and included here.  However, i have found an English language page of control instruction for a rental copy of the game which is als included here.  If you have access to the full manual and can scan it, please get in touch.

Several games here were Japanese releases only so the manuals have been translated by Google.  These are Cellophanes, Elemental Gearbolt, Gunbare, The Gun Shooting, The Gun Shooting 2, Guntu, Mighty Hits, and Puffy.  If you can offer superior human translations then please get in touch.

Moorhuhn 2 and Moorhuhn X were both German releases only so the manuals have been translated by Google.  If you can offer superior human translations then please get in touch.
