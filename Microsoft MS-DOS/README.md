# MS-DOS / IBM-compatible PC

This collection is not complete.

As far as i can tell, there are only three lightgun games available for MS-DOS.
These are:
* A.D. Cop
* A.D. Cop: Overseas Mission
* Bon Bon Paradise

If you have the manuals for any of these three games, or have evidence that other games for MS-DOS are light-gun compatible, then please get in touch.


The Wikipedia list of lightgun-games lists many others, however they are not lightgun games.  They were probably added to the list becasue they are known to be lightgun games on other systems, but on MS-DOS they are mouse games and can't be played with a lightgun.
